## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Im Lautaro Simontacchi

During my career and later as a professional, I was trained in the field of geodesy and cartography. This has given me a thorough knowledge of GNSS navigation systems, reference frames and systems, and remote sensing techniques such as the various satellite missions, including the recent Argentinean SAOCOM mission, the brand new LIDAR technology, both terrestrial and airborne, and photogrammetry, both airborne and terrestrial. My participation in various research and transfer projects has given me an excellent ability to work in groups. My more than 16 years of experience as a teacher and my participation in various congresses, workshops, etc. have allowed me to develop public speaking techniques for ideal presentations in front of different types of audiences.
I recently took the Data Scientist course at Henry as I decided to start working where I implement ML and IA tools.
